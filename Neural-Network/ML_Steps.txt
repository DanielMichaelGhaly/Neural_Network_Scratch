1. Feed Input then data flows from layer to layer then retrieve output.
    y = network(x,w)

2. Calculate error
    (e.g. E = 1/2(y* - y)^2

3. Adjust the parameters using gradient descent
to find the optimal parameters of the model.
    w <- w - alpha(delta E/delta w)

4. Start again

So if we have derivative of error E with respect to output Y
we need to get 2 things:
1. derivative of error with respect to parameters(Weights and Bias)
2. derivative of error with respect to input X

Derivative of Error with respect to parameter w is
derivative of error with respect to corresponding output MULTIPLIED the corresponding x
which in simple words derivative of error E with respect to output Y times X transpose.

Derivative of E with respect to Bias = derivative of E with respect to Y.

Derivative of E with respect to X is W transpose times derivative of E with respect to Y.
